    contentLong: 'His debugging skills are exceptional. He found and fixed issues that had been plaguing us for months. Our NPS went up by 15 points! What impressed me most was his systematic approach - he didn\'t just fix symptoms but identified root causes. He introduced better error tracking, improved our logging system, and even helped set up automated testing to prevent similar issues in the future. Working with Karol felt like having a senior architect on the team, not just a contractor.',

    contentLong: 'We needed someone who could jump into a complex codebase and deliver immediately. Karol exceeded all expectations. Within the first week, he had identified several critical performance bottlenecks and proposed solutions. By week three, he was delivering features as fast as our full-time team. His ability to work independently while staying aligned with team goals was remarkable. He documented his work thoroughly and was always available for questions. Truly one of the best contractors we\'ve ever worked with.',

    contentLong: 'Karol helped us rescue a failing project. His calm approach and technical expertise turned everything around. We were three months behind schedule with a demoralized team when he joined. He quickly assessed the situation, identified what was realistic to salvage, and created a recovery plan. He re-architected the most problematic parts, mentored junior developers, and helped restore confidence. We not only met our deadline but delivered a better product than originally planned. His leadership and technical skills were exactly what we needed.',
