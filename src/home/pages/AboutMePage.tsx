            With 20 years of experience in software development, I've seen technologies come and go, but the fundamentals remain the same: clean code, solid architecture, and a focus on solving real problems.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            I approach every project with curiosity and humility. There's always something new to learn, a better way to solve a problem, or a perspective I haven't considered yet.

            AI tools have revolutionized how we work, but they're toolsâ€”not replacements for experience and wisdom. I leverage AI to move faster while ensuring quality and the big picture are never compromised.

          I'm a full-stack developer who loves building things that matter. My journey in tech started over 20 years ago, and I've worked on everything from small startups to enterprise applications. I specialize in PHP, Laravel, Vue, React, and React Native, but I'm always exploring new technologies.

          When I'm not coding, you'll find me mentoring junior developers, writing technical documentation, or thinking about how to improve user experiences. I believe in giving back to the community that has given me so much.
